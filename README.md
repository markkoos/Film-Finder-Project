This is our work for the first project of this bootcamp. The goal of this project is to allow users to search up information about movies. After clicking on one of the 5 available results with the movie name, poster, and release year, the user will be taken to a second page with further information. There the user is introduced to a trailer of selected movie, a list of actors, and a short summary of the plot. There's also an option for a light or dark mode for the theme of the website.
